# Recipe

- 2 large containers of soft cream cheese (not light and not whipped!) or 2
bricks of cream cheese ~ Philadelphia always makes the best dip.
- 1 can crushed pineapple, drained (reserve the juice) ~ buy the larger can rather
than the tiny one, even though you may not need all of it ~ the tiny can is just
not enough pineapple.
- Green onions, chopped fairly small (include the white and green parts) ~ again,
to taste.
- Garlic powder ~ to taste, but, truthfully, in this recipe you can never have too
much garlic!!! Go for it!
- Sugar (optional) ~ to taste for added sweetness if you&#39;d like. I usually end up
adding some depending on how sweet the pineapple is.

## Instructions
Mix all ingredients, taste and add whatever you feel is lacking. I usually end
up pouring in some of the reserved juice, especially if I am using the harder
cream cheese bricks. Be careful, though, because you could end up with soup if
you add too much. It also adds sweetness and flavor, so I typically use at least
a little bit. As it sits in the fridge, it will thicken up some more and you can
always add more before serving if you'd like. It's best if it sits in the fridge
for a little while. I like to make it the night before so the oniony flavors mix
with the garlic and pineapple ~ yummy!! Just stir and taste before serving. If
you don't have time to do it overnight, just refrigerate a couple of hours and
you're good to go!
