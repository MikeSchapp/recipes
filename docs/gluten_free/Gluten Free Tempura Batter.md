# Gluten Free Tempura Batter

## Description

A light and crispy gluten-free tempura batter perfect for coating meats, seafood, tofu, or vegetables for frying.

## Ingredients

- 2 large room temperature egg whites
- 2 cups of rice flour, divided, plus additional for dredging
- 1 cup cold seltzer water
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix together 2 large room-temperature egg whites and 1 cup of rice or other non-wheat flour.
Slowly add flour until the egg is entirely absorbed. The mixture should be lumpy at this point.

2. Very slowly, stir in approximately 1 cup seltzer water until batter is smooth and easy to stir,
but still thick enough to coat the back of a spoon when you lift it up.
The texture should be slightly runnier than pancake batter.
Season batter very generously with salt and pepper.

3. To fry, dredge meat, seafood, drained and cubed tofu,
or vegetables in a small amount of the same flour you used for the batter.
Shake off excess flour and dip in tempura batter.
Shake off excess batter and fry in a neutral-tasting high-heat frying oil,
such as canola, corn, safflower, peanut, or sunflower, until batter is golden-brown on all sides.

4. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels before serving hot.

## Notes

- Preparation time: 10 minutes
- Best used immediately after mixing
- Works well with any veggies, seafood, or meats
