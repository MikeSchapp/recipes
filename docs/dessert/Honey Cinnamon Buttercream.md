Velvety smooth, buttercream is the king of frostings. This version is a Swiss meringue buttercream, which simply means that the egg whites and sugar are heated together before beating. The buttercream can also be flavored in many ways, which makes it very versatile. Any leftover buttercream freezes beautifully; it simply needs to be thawed to room temperature and re-whipped to be used another day. 
#### Ingredients:

* 2 large (2 ounces) egg whites, at room temperature
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 1/8 teaspoon fine kosher salt

#### Instructions
1. To prepare the meringue: To the bowl of a stand mixer, add egg whites and sugar; whisk to blend. Bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Place the bowl over the simmering water and heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture reaches 165Â°F (hot to the touch) on an instant-read thermometer. Remove mixture from the heat and attach bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip the mixture on high speed until it cools to room temperature, is light and billowing, and resembles marshmallow fluff. If the mixture is warm, it will melt the butter you'll be adding next, so touch the meringue and make sure it has cooled to room temperature before continuing. 
2. To prepare the buttercream: With the mixer on medium-high speed, add the butter, a couple of tablespoons at a time, allowing each addition to blend in fully before adding the next. Halfway through adding the butter, stop the mixer and use a silicone spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl thoroughly. Continue to whip until all the butter has been added and the mixture is velvety and smooth. Add cinnamon, honey, and salt; whip to incorporate. Transfer buttercream to a piping bag with a medium round tip. 
3. Keep the buttercream in airtight container in refrigerator for up to one week or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Let come to room temperature and rewhip in the mixer with the paddle attachment before using.
