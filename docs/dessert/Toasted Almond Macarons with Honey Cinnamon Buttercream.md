# Toasted Almond Macarons with Honey Cinnamon Buttercream

## Description

Delicate French almond meringue cookies with a toasty flavor, filled with smooth honey cinnamon buttercream - an elegant dessert for special occasions.

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cups (198g) confectioners' sugar
- 1 cup (96g) almond flour, carefully measured then sifted
- 3 large egg whites, room temperature
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted and finely chopped

### Filling

- [Honey Cinnamon Buttercream](../Honey%20Cinnamon%20Buttercream)

## Instructions

1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Draw 1 1/2-inch circles on the paper, then flip the paper over.

2. In a food processor, pulse confectioners' sugar and almond flour together for 30 seconds. Sift mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard any large pieces that remain.

3. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites with cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until foamy. Gradually add granulated sugar and increase speed to high. Whip until stiff peaks form.

4. Add vanilla and almond extract; whip until incorporated.

5. Using a rubber spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites in three additions. The batter should flow slowly like lava when lifted with the spatula.

6. Fold in 3 tablespoons of the toasted almond pieces.

7. Transfer batter to a piping bag with a round tip. Pipe 1 1/2-inch rounds onto prepared sheets. Tap the sheets firmly against the counter to release air bubbles.

8. Sprinkle remaining toasted almond pieces on top of half the macaron shells.

9. Let macarons rest at room temperature until a skin forms on the surface, 30-60 minutes.

10. Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Bake macarons one sheet at a time for 16-18 minutes, rotating halfway through.

11. Let macarons cool completely on the sheets before removing.

### Assembly

1. Prepare [Honey Cinnamon Buttercream](../Honey%20Cinnamon%20Buttercream) as directed.

2. Pipe buttercream on flat side of plain macaron shells, then top with almond-topped shells.

3. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 24 hours before serving to allow flavors to meld.
