# Espresso Macarons with Chocolate Ganache

## Description

Delicate coffee-flavored French macarons with a rich chocolate ganache filling - a sophisticated treat for coffee lovers.

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cups (198g) confectioners' sugar
- 1 cup (96g) almond flour, carefully measured then sifted
- 3 large egg whites, room temperature
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder dissolved in 1/2 teaspoon water
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Cocoa powder for dusting (optional)

### Filling

- [Chocolate Ganache](../Chocolate%20Ganache)

## Instructions

1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Draw 1 1/2-inch circles on the paper, then flip the paper over.

2. In a food processor, pulse confectioners' sugar and almond flour together for 30 seconds. Sift mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard any large pieces that remain.

3. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites with cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until foamy. Gradually add granulated sugar and increase speed to high. Whip until stiff peaks form.

4. Add dissolved espresso powder and vanilla; whip until incorporated and mixture is glossy with stiff peaks.

5. Using a rubber spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites in three additions. The batter should flow slowly like lava when lifted with the spatula.

6. Transfer batter to a piping bag with a round tip. Pipe 1 1/2-inch rounds onto prepared sheets. Tap the sheets firmly against the counter to release air bubbles.

7. Optional: Lightly dust half the macaron shells with cocoa powder.

8. Let macarons rest at room temperature until a skin forms on the surface, 30-60 minutes.

9. Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Bake macarons one sheet at a time for 16-18 minutes, rotating halfway through.

10. Let macarons cool completely on the sheets before removing.

### Assembly

1. Prepare [Chocolate Ganache](../Chocolate%20Ganache) as directed.

2. Pipe ganache on flat side of plain macaron shells, then top with cocoa-dusted shells (if used).

3. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 24 hours before serving to allow flavors to meld.
