# Recipe
- Ribeye Steak (Recommend a 1 1/2 steak from Costco)
- Montreal Steak Seasoning
## Instructions
1) Preheat Oven to lowest setting (I'd recommend between 140-175)

2) Use a meat thermometer to keep tabs on the temperature. (Looking for about 97 degrees for a rare steak.
Increase by 5 degrees for MR)

3) Cook until alarm goes off or target temp is achieved.

4) When this is close to temp, start pre heating a skillet on the stove top.

5) Cook the steak on stove top for 2 mins per side, or until golden brown.
