# Reverse Sear Steak

## Description

A foolproof method for perfectly cooked steak with a beautiful crust and even doneness throughout by slow-cooking first, then searing at high heat.

## Ingredients

- Thick Cut Steak (at least 1.5 inches thick)
- Salt and Pepper
- High smoke point oil like avocado oil or ghee
- Optional: garlic, rosemary, thyme, butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 225-275°F (107-135°C)

2. Season steak generously with salt and pepper on all sides

3. Place steak on a wire rack over a baking sheet

4. Insert a meat thermometer if using

5. Place in oven and cook until internal temperature reaches:
   - 115°F (46°C) for rare
   - 125°F (52°C) for medium-rare
   - 135°F (57°C) for medium
   - 145°F (63°C) for medium-well

6. Remove steak from oven and let rest while heating a cast iron pan until smoking hot

7. Add a small amount of high smoke point oil to the pan

8. Sear steak for 30-60 seconds on each side until a dark crust forms

9. Optional: in the last minute of searing, add butter, crushed garlic cloves, and herb sprigs to the pan and baste the steak

10. Let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing against the grain

## Notes

- Preparation time: 5 minutes
- Cooking time: 45-60 minutes (depending on thickness and desired doneness)
- The reverse sear method works especially well for thick cut ribeye, NY strip, or filet mignon
