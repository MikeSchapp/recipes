# Beef with Onions and Wine

## Description

A rustic, comforting beef dish slowly braised with sweet onions and red wine until fork-tender, creating a rich sauce perfect for serving over mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 3 large onions, sliced into half-moons
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups dry red wine
- 2 cups beef broth
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C).

2. Pat beef cubes dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper.

3. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in batches, about 2-3 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd the pan. Transfer browned beef to a plate.

4. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the Dutch oven. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply caramelized, about 15-20 minutes.

5. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

6. Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously.

7. Slowly add red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.

8. Add beef broth, bay leaves, and thyme. Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot.

9. Bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook for 2-2.5 hours, or until beef is very tender.

10. Remove bay leaves, season with additional salt and pepper if needed, and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
