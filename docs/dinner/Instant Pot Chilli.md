# Instant Pot Chilli

## Description

A quick and hearty chili made in the Instant Pot, featuring tender beef, beans, and robust spices for a comforting meal ready in a fraction of the traditional cooking time.

## Ingredients

- 3 pounds ground beef
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce
- 1 can (15 oz) kidney beans, drained
- 1 can (15 oz) pinto beans, drained
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup beef broth or water

## Instructions

1. Set Instant Pot to Sauté mode. Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain excess grease if needed.

2. Add diced onion and bell pepper to the pot and sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened.

3. Add all spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper). Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. Pour in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, both types of beans, and beef broth. Stir to combine.

5. Close the Instant Pot lid and set to Manual/Pressure Cook for 15 minutes at high pressure.

6. When cooking is complete, allow natural pressure release for 10 minutes, then quick release any remaining pressure.

7. Open the lid and stir. If the chili is too thin, use the Sauté function to simmer for a few minutes to thicken.
