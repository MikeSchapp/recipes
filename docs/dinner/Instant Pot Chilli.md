## Instructions
1. Turn your instant pot to sauté and add the bacon.

2. Cook until crisp, stirring often to cook evenly.

3. Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate.

4. Add the onions and peppers and cook until tender.

5. Add the meat and cook until browned.

6. Drain off any excess grease, we just tilt the pot and use a large spoon.

7. Add all of the remaining ingredients and 3/4 of the bacon and stir to combine.

8. Turn the instant pot to chili (if you don't have a "chili" setting, use the "manual" setting) and cook for 18-20 minutes*. Allow pressure to release for 10-15 minutes or quick release with the vent.

9. Serve with limes, sour cream, cheese, and a little bacon!
