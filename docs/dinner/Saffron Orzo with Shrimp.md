# Saffron Orzo with Shrimp

## Description

A delicate and flavorful pasta dish combining tender orzo with saffron's distinctive aroma and succulent shrimp.

## Ingredients

- 4 cups Reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 1 tsp Saffron threads
- 1 pound Orzo
- 7 Tbsp Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
- 1/4 cup Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 Juice of 1 lemon
- 3 tsp salt
- 2 tsp Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound Large shrimp, peeled and deveined

## Instructions

1. In a large pot bring the chicken broth to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, bringing
the broth to a simmer.

2. Add the saffron, stir, and simmer until the saffron has "bloomed," about
5 minutes.

3. Return the heat to medium and bring the stock to a boil then add the orzo and cook
until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 8-10 minutes.

4. Drain the orzo and transfer to a large bowl. Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil, the parsley, half of the lemon juice, 2
teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and combine thoroughly.

5. In a bowl toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and the remaining lemon
juice. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.

6. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook until the shrimp are just turning pink, about 2 minutes
per side. Add the shrimp to the bowl with the orzo. Toss to combine and serve.
