# Chicken & Sun Dried Tomatoes over Pasta

## Description

A flavorful pasta dish featuring tender chicken and sweet sun-dried tomatoes in a creamy sauce, perfect for a satisfying weeknight dinner.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound pasta of choice (fettuccine or penne work well)
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions.

2. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

3. Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Add to the skillet and cook until golden brown and no longer pink inside, about 5-6 minutes.

4. Reduce heat to medium and add minced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

5. Add chicken broth to the skillet and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

6. Pour in heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken.

7. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce is smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

8. Drain the cooked pasta and add it directly to the sauce. Toss to coat evenly.

9. Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and fresh basil if desired.
