# Creamy Lemon Pasta

## Description

A bright, silky pasta dish featuring fresh lemon flavor balanced with rich cream and sharp Parmesan cheese - ready in just 20 minutes.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound linguine or spaghetti
- 2 lemons, zested and juiced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Fresh basil or parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. While pasta is cooking, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes until garlic is fragrant but not browned.

3. Reduce heat to medium-low and add heavy cream to the skillet. Simmer gently for about 2 minutes.

4. Add drained pasta to the skillet and toss to coat with the sauce. If sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.

5. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. Serve immediately, topped with additional Parmesan cheese and chopped herbs.

## Notes

- Preparation time: 5 minutes
- Cooking time: 15 minutes

- For a lighter version, substitute half of the cream with reserved pasta water
